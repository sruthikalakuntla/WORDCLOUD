# wordcloud
Word Cloud is a straightforward and visually appealing visualization method for text.
They are used in various contexts as a means to provide an overview by distilling text down to
those words that appear with highest frequency. Typically, this is done in a static way as pure
text summarization. Word cloud can make monotonous data into a stunning visualization format
to highlight important textual content and immediately convey crucial information. It is easy to
understand visual data rather than vocal data as they are easy to comprehend and memorize,
hence word clouds can be used for the same. Also, they can be exercised to analyze data from
social network websites and stream service platforms for identifying the trending updates. This
approach is an effective technique used to solve text analysis tasks and evaluate it as a qualitative
behaviour.
The input data may consist of articles and pronouns like ‘a’, ‘the’, ‘and’, ‘he’, etc which
have to be ignored and the frequency of significant words should be considered to produce a
word cloud. Depending on the frequency of the word, the size of the word will vary while
producing a word cloud. In addition to pre-existing static text word cloud, the project also
proposes an improvement for dynamic data input from the user, with speech recognition enabled.
